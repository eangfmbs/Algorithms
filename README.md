Algorithms
==========

This Repository contains various implementation of parallel and serial sorting algorithms. 
This was done as a part of research study for comparing the practical running times for 
parallel search vs serial search. This study was done as a part of course project for 
Advanced Algorithm Topics(CSCI 432 at Montana State University), during Fall 2010.
