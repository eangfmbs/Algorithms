Algorithms
==========

This Repository contains various implementation of parallel and serial sorting algorithms. This was done as a part of research study for comparing the practical running times for parallel search vs serial search. This study was done as a part of course project for Advanced Algorithm Topics(CSCI 432 at Montana State University)
